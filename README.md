Good day po, Sir!
I used po yong tip ninyo nakaraang activity which is this:
*TIP* Compress your video using ffmpeg by issuing this command to your terminal (requires ffmpeg in your path)
ffmpeg -i INPUTVIDEO.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 37 -preset ultrafast -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart -vf scale=-2:720 OUTPUT_VIDEO.mp4
The quality po is not that clear, it's because of that compressor po.

If you can't watch the video po. 
Here's a googledrive video link that I uploaded in my drive:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LN_7tm43tVL7I5OmPLn5IcAb-BU4Q9Rb?usp=drive_link

Which is much clearer po compared sa inupload ko pong video dito sa repository.

Thank you po!
